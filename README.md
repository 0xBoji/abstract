Adapter modules are smart-contracts that offer an interface or feature that is user-agnostic. There contracts are not migratable and have no admin assigned to them.  
Therefore their usage is fully permissionless.


## Adapter implementation

Implementation of project-specific adapter are usually maintained in the original project repository or in a fork to ensure maintanability and ownership.
Here are the repos in which the current implementations can be found : 

Wyndex : https://github.com/AbstractSDK/wynddex.git
Astroport: https://github.com/AbstractSDK/astroport-core.git
Osmosis: https://github.com/AbstractSDK/osmosis-rust.git
